                <h2>The Case</h2>
                <p>
                  On April 15, 1920, two men were murdered during a payroll robbery in 
                  South Braintree, Massachusetts. Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti 
                  were arrested, tried, and convicted in an atmosphere of fear and prejudice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Their case became a global symbol of injustice and the dangers of 
                  political persecution, inspiring generations of activists, artists, 
                  and scholars.
