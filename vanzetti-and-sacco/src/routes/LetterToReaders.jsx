Dear comrades and visitors to the site, 
</p> 
<p>
Today is the 92nd anniversary of Sacco and Vanzetti's deaths. I don't think it would be exaggerating to say most young people don't know who they are or how significant their contributions as individuals were to history, the causes of anarchism, socialism, communism, or to art and literature more broadly. 
</p>
<p>
It is time to move on from their trial and from arguing for their innocence. If you read the evidence, it's clear that they didn't commit the crimes they were electrocuted for. It's time to focus on their contributions as humans who cared so deeply about their causes, who inspired multiple generations of working class people, artists, writers and activists, and who represented so many things to so many people. We've been so caught up in the evidence of the case that we've forgotten the humans at the heart of it.
</p>
<p>
I am a former "literature person" and a current software developer. When I was in college at Indiana University, I stumbled upon the Sacco and Vanzetti manuscripts in the Lilly Library during a class on working with modern literary archives. — I remember that day like it was yesterday. I had recognized their names from somewhere, but I couldn't remember where from, so as I read through Vanzetti's handwritten notes on old, yellowing notebook paper, I couldn't stop.  He seemed so alive and I could have just as well been reading letters from an old friend. I read through a year of what the library had before the patient and kind librarian had to kick me out because they were closing. 
</p>
<p>
Reader, I came back the next day. 
</p> 
<p>
And the next day.  
</p>
<p>
And well, obviously, here I am writing this letter to you.
</p> 
<p>
My professor often saw me in there reading and approached me one day about potentially writing an honors thesis on the letters — I had never considered the idea of even writing a thesis before and didn't know what it was — but I did it. I wrote one about how much exists in the letters at the Lilly Library that had never been published or had been taken out of the only English publications there were.  I wanted to create a new edition so that people who don't have access to a rare books library can experience what I had reading the letters, but I felt like I had to do it in academia because that's the world I came from. 
</p> 
<p>
I believed that I needed some kind of academic credibility to make sure that Sacco and Vanzetti's words were accessible to a new generation, even though almost all the words I cared to read were written by people who didn't have the same levels of education as even me working through my Bachelor's degree. I was also pressured to put a spin of false neutrality on my opinions on the case, and told by various people that my audience should primarily be Ivory Tower historians instead of those whom Sacco and Vanzetti had been writing in the first place — the worker.
</p>
<p>
Believing that I needed another degree and more credibility to be able to complete this project is what drew me to my Master's program. When I got there, I found out that a lot of people didn't understand what I wanted to do at all and that my project didn't fit in at an English Department. The letters weren't literature with a capital L. I tried my hardest to work on it in addition to my course load, but it was hard at times. I didn't get to make much progress because I was so overwhelmed with other things. That said, I did get the opportunity to write my Master's thesis on their letters and continue work I started in my undergrad and I had great mentorship and support through that process. I left more hungry than ever to finish my project. 
</p> 
<p>
I graduated and I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do next— all I knew is I wanted to keep working on my edition. I considered going for a PhD — I even applied to a few programs I knew I wouldn't be (and wasn't) accepted to — because I thought that maybe the dissertation time would allow me to do the work of transcribing, compiling, at times translating, pages of heartfelt handwritten letters in a way that preserved their integrity and didn't omit things to make traditional book publishers happy. 
</p>
<p>
Before I even got rejection letters back from universities, I knew I didn't want to pursue my PhD. It felt wrong to be seeking the approval of institutions that had a literal hand in the executions of Sacco and Vanzetti (I see you, Harvard), even if there are some great people and professors in them who have supported my project every single step of the way— just as there were great people and professors in those institutions who had supported Sacco and Vanzetti's efforts to be freed, even as the, as Vanzetti would say, corporate bosses did everything in their power to murder them.  My undergraduate thesis advisor, Christoph Irmscher, my Master's thesis advisor, Maryemma Graham, and my thesis committees were deeply supportive of this project, and I owe a lot to the Lilly Library who awarded me the Everett Helm Visiting Fellowship to continue my research on the manuscripts they own related to the case and all the sponsors of the National Collegiate Book Collecting Contest - the prize for my collection of materials on the case made it more possible for me to do this work, and of course all of the friends I've met who share my enthusiasm about Sacco and Vanzetti and have shared with and taught me along the way. Thank you. 
</p> 
<p>
Anyway, I had to do something else. I wanted to pursue working on the letters, but compiling a traditional book edition — which I've been slowly doing since 2013 with few eyes on it — wasn't fast enough for me. The more I learned about how I could go about publishing it, the more I found that it would probably have to be an expensive academic book if I was even able to convince a publisher to do what I felt would do the letters justice and would serve Sacco and Vanzetti's legacy.
</p> 
<p>
I want to make this edition of their letters I've been working on freely accessible to whoever wants to read them.  That is what Sacco and Vanzetti said they wanted before they were executed. I want to make sure that no one capitalizes on this project because that would be directly antithetical to everything the men stood for. I want to share all of the fascinating things I've learned about the case and Sacco and Vanzetti and the Defense Committee — much of which isn't yet published (I know because I've read almost everything that has been) — with anyone who wants to know about it without having to convince a publisher that it's worthy, spend too much time having to entertain unnecessary arguments about whether or not they were guilty (spoiler alert: they weren't), or bribe a kid to get off their screen and read something that looks like a textbook. 
</p> 
<p>
What better way to do all of these things than a website? Especially now that I have the skills to build it myself and to make it interactive. 
</p> 
<p >
Today is the 92nd anniversary of Sacco and Vanzetti's executions and the first day of the website, Vanzetti and Sacco. This is just the birth of this project's online life, so there isn't anything on here yet, but I'm so beyond excited to get it out for you to read and explore.
</p>
<p>
A lot of people don't know this because the line was cut from the only circulated English-language publication of Sacco and Vanzetti's letters, The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti ed. Marion Frankfurter and Gardner Jackson, but Vanzetti almost always ended his letters with words of hope and encouragement. He often told Mary Donovan, the Sacco Vanzetti Defense Committee secretary for example, to take care of herself and to "be of good heart." 
</p> 
<p>
It's time to acknowledge Sacco and Vanzetti as the real humans and unique individuals that they were. Their names are so often lumped together that people don't realize how different their personalities are and how much humor and ambition and drive Vanzetti had and how Sacco felt everything so deeply.
</p> 
<p>
I don't think they'd want us to mourn their murderous deaths or continue to argue about whether they were really guilty or innocent on this 92nd anniversary of their executions — They would want us to take their words, their message, and their hope for the world and carry it on in our actions. As this site gets built out, you'll see what I mean.
</p> 
<p>
So with that dear comrades and friends, be of good heart and carry on.
